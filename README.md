## **Data Structure Overview**

OstrichDB organizes data into three levels:

- **Records**: The smallest unit of data. e.g user_name, age, email. Format: [name] :[type]: [value]
- **Clusters**: Groups of related records. Given a name and an id upon creation.
- **Collections**: Database files containing clusters, Have the '.ostrichdb' extension.

---

## **Query Structure (CLPs)**

From the OstrichDB CLI, queries are typically broken into **three types of tokens**, called **CLPs**, to improve readability and ensure clear instructions.

**Note:** Not all queries require all 3 tokens.

1. **(C)ommand Token**: Specifies the operation to perform (e.g., `NEW`, `ERASE`, `RENAME`).
2. **(L)ocation Token**: The path using dot notation that the query will be performed on (e.g., `foo.bar.baz`).
3. **(P)arameter Token(s)**: Additional parameters that change the behavior of the query (e.g., `TO`, `OF_TYPE`).

---

### **Query Walkthrough**

```bash
NEW foo.bar.baz OF_TYPE []STRING
```
Explanation:
- **`NEW`**: Create a new data structure (Command token).
- **`foo`**: The first data structure always points to a collection. (Location token).
- **`bar`**: The second data structure always to a cluster within the collection. (Location token).
- **`baz`**: The third data structure is always a record within the cluster. (Location token).
- **`OF_TYPE`**: Specifies the data type of the record (Parameter token). Note: Only records are given data types.
- **`[]STRING`**: Token mapped to the Parameter token that precedes it. The record will be an array of strings.

---

## **Supported Command Tokens**

### **Single-Token Operations**
These tokens perform a task without any additional arguments.

- **`AGENT`**: Starts the OstrichDB natural language processor. Requires the server to be running in another terminal.
- **`VERSION`**: Displays the current version of OstrichDB.
- **`LOGOUT`**: Logs out the current user.
- **`EXIT`**: Ends the session and closes the DBMS.
- **`RESTART`**: Restarts the program.
- **`REBUILD`**: Rebuilds the DBMS and restarts the program.
- **`SERVE/SERVER`**: Turns on the OstrichDB server allowing http requests to be made.
- **`HELP`**: Displays general help information or detailed help when chained with specific tokens.
- **`TREE`**: Displays the entire data structure in a tree format.
- **`CLEAR`**: Clears the console screen.
- **`HISTORY`**: Shows the current users command history.
- **`DESTROY`**: Completeley destorys the entire DBMS. Including all databases, users, configs, and logs.
- **`BENCHMARK`**: Runs a benchmark test on the DBMS to test performance. Can be run with or without parameters.

---

### **Multi-Token Tokens**
These tokens are used to construct queries and require one or more additional tokens.

- **`NEW`**: Create a new collection, cluster, record, or user.
- **`ERASE`**: Delete a collection, cluster, or record.
- **`RENAME`**: Rename an existing object.
- **`FETCH`**: Retrieve data from a collection, cluster, or record.
- **`SET`**: Assign a value to a record or configuration.
- **`BACKUP`**: Create a backup of a specific collection.
- **`PURGE`**: Removes all data from an object while maintaining the object structure.
- **`COUNT`**: Returns the number of objects within a scope. Paired with the plural form of the object type (e.g., `RECORDS`, `CLUSTERS`).
- **`SIZE_OF`**: Returns the size in bytes of an object.
- **`TYPE_OF`**: Returns the type of a record.
- **`CHANGE_TYPE`**: Allows you to change the type of a record.
- **`HELP`**: Displays help information for a specific token.
- **`ISOLATE`**: Quarantines a collection file. Preventing any further changes to the file
- **`WHERE`**: Searches for the location of a single or several record(s) or cluster(s). DOES NOT WORK WITH COLLECTIONS.
- **`VALIDATE`**: Validates a collection file for any errors or corruption.
- **`BENCHMARK`**: Runs a benchmark test on the DBMS to test performance. Can be run with or without parameters.
- **`LOCK`**: Used to change the access mode of a collection. Using `LOCK {collection_name} -r` sets a collection to Read-Only. Removing the `-r` will set a collection to Inaccessible.
- **`UNLOCK`**: Changes the access mode of a collection to the default Read-Write.
- **`ENC`** : Encrypts a collection.
- **`DEC`** : Decrypts a currently encrypted collection.  Use at own discretion.
- **`IMPORT`**: Allows the user to import a .csv or .json files into OstrichDB.
---

### **Parameters**
Modifiers adjust the behavior of queries. The current supported modifiers are:

- **`OF_TYPE`**: Specifies the type of a new record (e.g., INT, STR, []BOOL)
- **`WITH`**: Used to assign a value to a record in the same command you are creating it(e.g `NEW {collection_name}.{cluster_name}.{record_name} OF_TYPE {record_type} WITH {record_value}`)
- **`TO`**: Used to assign a new value or name to a data structure or config(e.g `RENAME {old_collection_name} to {new_collection_name}`)

### **Query Chaining**
OstrichDB supports query chaining, allowing you to execute multiple queries in sequence with a single input. To chain queries together add the `&&` operator at the end of each valid query, and they will be executed in the order they appear.

Example:
```bash
RENAME foo.bar.baz TO goob && FETCH fetch foo.bar.goob
```


## **Supported Record Data Type Tokens**
When setting a record value, you must specify the records data type by using the `OF_TYPE` modifier. Some types have a shorthand notation for convenience.

### Primary data types include:
  - **`INTEGER`**: Integer values. Short-hand: `INT`.
  - **`STRING`**: Any text value longer than 1 character. Short-hand: `STR`.
  - **`FLOAT`**: Floating-point numbers. Short-hand: `FLT`.
  - **`BOOLEAN`**: true or false values. Short-hand: `BOOL`.
  - **`CHAR`**: Single character values. No short-hand.

## **Usage Examples**
   ```bash

   # Create a new record:
   # Note: If collection staff and cluster engineering do not exist
   # Don't worry, that will be created all at once!
   NEW staff.engineering.team_one OF_TYPE []STRING WITH "John","Ana","Wayne"
   # Fetch the record value:
   FETCH staff.engineers.team_one
   # Rename a cluster:
   RENAME staff.engineering TO HR
   # Get the size of a cluster:
   SIZE_OF staff.HR
   # Erase a record:
   ERASE staff.HR.team_one
   # Get a count of all collections in the database:
   COUNT COLLECTIONS
   #Get help information for a specific token:

## **Configs**
OstrichDB has a configuration file that allows the user to customize certain aspects of the DBMS to their liking.

- **`HELP_IS_VERBOSE`**: Decide whether help information is simple or verbose. Default is `false`
- **`SUPPRESS_ERRORS`**: Show or hide error messages. Default is `false`
- **`LIMIT_HISTORY`**: Ensure whether a users query history does or does not exceed the built in limit(100) Default is `true`
- **`AUTO_SERVE`**: Determines if the built-in OstrichDB server automatically starts the moment the user logs in. Default is `true`
- **`LIMIT_SESSION_TIME`**: Determines if the CLI session timer is enabled or disabled. If enabled a user can only be logged in for 24hrs. Default is `true`

**Note: ALL configs must be set using the following query:**
