### Pull Requests

1. **Branch Naming Convention:**
   - Use no more than five words, separated by hyphens.
   - If there's an associated issue, add the issue number at the end of the branch name.
   - Example: `add-user-authentication-feature-123`

2. **Code Style:**
   - Keep your code as close to the current style in the project as possible.
   - Consistency with existing code is prioritized over strict adherence to external style guides.

3. **Pull Request Size:**
   - Keep PRs relatively small and focused.
   - Avoid submitting PRs with thousands of lines of changes.
   - If a feature requires extensive changes, consider breaking it into smaller, logically separated PRs.

4. **Commits:**
   - Keep commits atomic and focused on a single change.
   - Use clear and descriptive commit messages.

5. **Code Review:**
   - Be open to feedback and be responsive during the code review process.
   - Make requested changes promptly or discuss why they might not be necessary.

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

* `Bug:` - Issues that are bugs.
* `Feature:` - Issues that are feature requests.
* `Documentation` - Issues that are related to documentation.

## Getting Started

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
   * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
   * Send a pull request.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:

* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to 'metadata' files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another
